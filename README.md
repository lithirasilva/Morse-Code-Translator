# 🔡 Morse Code Translator

A desktop application built with Java that provides an intuitive way to encode, decode, and reverse Morse code messages using a binary tree structure.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔀 **Encode Text to Morse Code**: Translate plain text into Morse code.
- 🔄 **Decode Morse Code to Text**: Convert Morse code back into plain text.
- ⏪ **Reverse Encoding/Decoding**: Handle bidirectional translation seamlessly.
- 🌳 **Binary Tree Structure**: Implements a binary tree for Morse code storage and retrieval.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (version 8 or higher)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lithirasilva/Morse-Code-Translator.git
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
4. Run the application:
   - Locate the `Main` class and run it to launch the translator.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Binary Tree Implementation**:
   - The binary tree is used to map Morse code to corresponding text characters.
   - Each node represents a dot (`.`) or dash (`-`) in the Morse code hierarchy.

2. **Encoding**:
   - The application traverses the binary tree to encode plain text into Morse code.

3. **Decoding**:
   - The Morse code is parsed to traverse the binary tree and retrieve the corresponding text characters.
